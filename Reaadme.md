Descriptions of Common Tasks:

Sorting Problem (Sorting):
Task: Sort a list of integers or strings efficiently using algorithms like Merge Sort, Quick Sort, or Heap Sort to ensure time complexity is O(n log n).

Searching Algorithms (Searching):
Task: Implement a function to search for a value in a list or matrix, potentially using binary search for optimized execution time.

Data Structures Problems (MaxStacking):
Task: Solve problems using data structures like linked lists, stacks, queues, or binary trees, ensuring efficient operations like insertion, deletion, or retrieval.

String Anagrams Manipulation StringAnagrams):
Task: Manipulate strings to find patterns, perform transformations, or solve problems like checking for anagrams or finding substrings.

Recursion Factorial Problems (RecursionFactorial):
Task: Use recursion to solve problems like calculating factorials, Fibonacci sequences, or exploring all possible combinations in a dataset.

Dynamic Programming Problems (FibonacciDynamicProgramming):
Task: Optimize solutions using dynamic programming techniques, avoiding inefficient recursive approaches.

Matrix Rotation Logic (MatrixRotation):
Task: Rotate a given square matrix (N x N) by 90 degrees clockwise, modifying the matrix in-place (without using extra space for another matrix). The goal is to rearrange the elements of the input matrix to achieve the rotated version.

Performance and Complexity (MostFrequentElement ):
Task: Find the element that appears the most frequently in a given array of integers. If there are multiple elements with the same highest frequency, return the one that appears first when traversing the array.

Simulation Challenges: Parking Lot Simulation (ParkingLot):
Task: demonstrate a simple and efficient parking lot management system using core Java concepts like HashMap, conditional statements, and iterative structures.
