/*
 * Problem Description: Dining Philosophers Problem
 *
 * The Dining Philosophers Problem is a classic synchronization problem where a set of philosophers are seated at a table,
 * each with a fork on either side. They must alternate between thinking and eating, but they need both forks to eat.
 * The challenge is to prevent deadlock (where all philosophers are waiting for forks and cannot make progress) and starvation (where some philosophers are perpetually unable to eat).
 *
 * Approach:
 * - The problem is solved using locks to synchronize access to shared resources (forks).
 * - Each philosopher has two forks: one on the left and one on the right. Philosophers need both forks to eat.
 * - To avoid deadlock, philosophers acquire the left fork first and the right fork second. This ensures that they don't end up in a situation where each philosopher is holding one fork and waiting for the other.
 * - If a philosopher can't get both forks (e.g., if the right fork is already taken), they will release the left fork and retry, ensuring fairness and preventing deadlock.
 * - The philosophers will continuously alternate between thinking and eating.
 *
 * Requirements:
 * - The solution must ensure that no two philosophers can eat at the same time (they need exclusive access to their forks).
 * - The system must avoid deadlocks and starvation by ensuring that philosophers have a fair opportunity to pick up both forks.
 *
 * Constraints:
 * - The number of philosophers and forks is the same.
 * - Philosophers must think before they eat and after they eat.
 *
 * Time Complexity:
 * - Each philosopher performs a sequence of actions (thinking, picking up forks, eating, putting down forks) repeatedly.
 * - The time complexity for each philosopherâ€™s actions is O(1), but since each philosopher runs continuously in a loop, the overall complexity depends on the number of philosophers and the number of iterations.
 *
 * Space Complexity:
 * - The space complexity is O(N), where N is the number of philosophers, as we store a lock for each fork.
 *
 * This approach ensures that all philosophers can eat without causing a deadlock or starvation while respecting synchronization constraints.
